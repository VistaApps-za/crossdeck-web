/**
 * Schema-lock test for `crossdeck.contract_failed`.
 *
 * The Web SDK's reportContractFailure(...) must:
 *   1. Send a payload whose keys are exactly the allowed-fields set
 *      (required ∪ optional) from
 *      contracts/diagnostics/contract-failed-payload-schema-lock.json.
 *   2. Route to `/v1/events` (the same endpoint customer cd.track()
 *      uses) UNDER THE HARDCODED RELIABILITY PUBLISHABLE KEY — so
 *      the event lands in the Crossdeck reliability project's events
 *      warehouse, NOT in the customer's project. The hardcoded key is
 *      the structural guarantee that customer-side telemetry stays
 *      isolated from CD-side reliability telemetry.
 *   3. NEVER include any forbidden field even if the caller's input
 *      were to carry one.
 *
 * Pre-2026-05-28 the endpoint was `/v1/sdk/diagnostic` (a CD-specific
 * write into a top-level `sdkDiagnostics` collection). That collection
 * had no dashboard surface, so failures piled up invisibly. The new
 * routing reuses the customer-events pipeline — failures appear in
 * the Crossdeck project's events-explorer / event-breakdown / alerts
 * like any other custom event.
 *
 * The schema-lock contract is the structural defence behind the
 * independent-controller flow in Privacy Policy §6 — these tests
 * fail loudly the moment the wire shape drifts.
