/**
 * _diagnostic-telemetry.ts
 *
 * Single-fire reliability telemetry for the SDK. Carries the
 * `crossdeck.contract_failed` event ONE WAY to the Crossdeck
 * reliability endpoint — NEVER the customer's appId, NEVER the
 * customer's track() pipeline, NEVER visible in the customer's
 * dashboard.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Crossdeck is an independent controller for SDK Diagnostic
 * Telemetry (Privacy Policy §6, "Flow B"). The legitimate-interest
 * basis depends on the payload remaining diagnostic-only: no
 * end-user identifiers, no free-form text, no stack frames. The
 * schema-lock contract at
 * `contracts/diagnostics/contract-failed-payload-schema-lock.json`
 * fixes the wire shape; this module is the call site that has to
 * honour it.
 *
 * Why bypass the existing HttpClient
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The HttpClient is configured for the customer's project (their
 * API key, their endpoint). Routing reliability telemetry through
 * it would (a) bill against the customer's event quota and (b)
 * show individual contract failures in their dashboard, which is
 * neither the customer's nor Crossdeck's intent. A separate one-way
 * path is the structural guarantee.
 *
 * PROVISIONING NOTE
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The reliability endpoint URL + publishable key below are LITERAL
 * CONSTANTS shipped in the SDK. Until the reliability project is
 * minted, the placeholder values disable telemetry — the function
 * returns early without making a request. After provisioning, swap
 * the placeholders for the real values; the same values go into the
 * backend at backend/src/api/v1-sdk-diagnostic.ts.
