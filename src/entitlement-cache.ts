/**
 * Durable last-known-good cache of the customer's entitlements.
 *
 * This cache is NOT a second source of truth. Crossdeck remains the
 * only source; this is the SDK's local copy of what the server last
 * told us — a cache that doesn't forget during a network partition.
 *
 * Durability contract (the RevenueCat model):
 *   - Every successful server read is persisted to device storage
 *     (localStorage, via the SDK's storage adapter).
 *   - On SDK boot the cache hydrates from storage synchronously, so
 *     isEntitled() answers correctly from the very first call — there
 *     is no cold-start window where a returning Pro customer reads as
 *     free.
 *   - When the server is unreachable, the SDK keeps serving the last
 *     entitlements it successfully fetched. A failed refresh never
 *     reaches setFromList(), so it cannot clear the cache; only a
 *     SUCCESSFUL fetch replaces it. An outage can never fail a paying
 *     customer down to free.
 *   - Staleness alone never returns false. Each entitlement is honoured
 *     against its OWN validUntil instead — a time-based trial expiry
 *     still applies even mid-partition, a still-valid Pro entitlement
 *     rides the outage out.
 *   - Staleness is VISIBLE, not silent. validUntil covers time-based
 *     expiry; it does NOT cover an event-based revoke (chargeback,
 *     refund, fraud) — that has no validUntil, so the cache would keep
 *     serving a revoked customer through an outage. Serving them is the
 *     right trade (don't lock real payers out), but unbounded-and-
 *     invisible is the bug. So: once a refresh ATTEMPT fails (or the
 *     data ages past staleAfterMs) the cache is marked stale —
 *     isStale / freshness are surfaced in diagnostics(). It keeps
 *     serving last-known-good; the staleness is just no longer hidden.
 *
 * The cache is wiped only on reset() (logout) and on an identity switch
 * — never by a TTL.
 *
 * Reactive listener API
 * ---------------------
 * `subscribe(listener)` registers a callback fired every time the cache
 * mutates (setFromList or clear) — the foundation for the
 * `useEntitlement` React hook and other framework bindings. Semantics:
 *   - Fired AFTER the mutation, so the listener sees fresh state.
 *   - Fire-and-forget: a throwing listener is swallowed (and counted)
 *     so a buggy consumer can't crash the SDK or other listeners.
 *   - Unsubscribe is idempotent.
 *   - Listeners are NOT fired on subscribe — a caller that wants the
 *     initial state reads isEntitled() / list() synchronously, which
 *     work from boot thanks to hydration above.
