/**
 * Machine-readable index of every error code the SDK can throw, with
 * a short description and a hint on what action to take. Published
 * verbatim as `crossdeck-error-codes.json` in the npm tarball so AI
 * integration assistants, error-aggregator dashboards (Sentry,
 * DataDog), and the Crossdeck dashboard can render human-friendly
 * messages without parsing freeform `message` strings.
 *
 * Stripe publishes the same surface at stripe.com/docs/error-codes;
 * developers love it because every code has a canonical "what does
 * this mean / what should I do" answer.
 *
 * Adding a new error code:
 *   1. Add the code string to the union in `errors.ts` (where used).
 *   2. Add an entry here.
 *   3. The next `npm run build` regenerates the JSON sidecar.
 *
 * Keep entries terse — the consumer surfaces this in tooltips and
 * automated tickets, not in long-form docs.
